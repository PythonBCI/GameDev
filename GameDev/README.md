## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download Godot 4.3+
- Go to [godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Download Godot 4.3 or later for your platform
- Extract and run Godot

### 2. Open the Project
- In Godot, click "Import"
- Select the `project.godot` file from this folder
- Click "Import & Edit"

### 3. Play the Game
- Press F5 or click the "Play" button
- You should see a working game with:
  - Purple hive core in the center
  - Blue worker drone nearby
  - Green biomass and gray mineral nodes
  - Orange enemies moving around
  - Resource counter at the top
  - Building menu on the left

## 🎮 How to Play

### World Building Tools
The game now includes comprehensive world-building tools:

**Left-Click Building:**
- Click any building button in the left menu
- Left-click anywhere on the map to place the unit/structure
- Right-click to cancel building mode

**Available Units:**
- **Worker Drone** (1 Biomass) - Basic resource gatherer
- **Harvester** (2 Biomass) - Combat unit that hunts enemies
- **Queen** (5 Biomass + 2 Genetic) - Lays eggs and manages hive
- **Larvae** (1 Secretion) - Grows into worker drones

**Available Structures:**
- **Spire** (3 Minerals) - Defensive structure
- **Nursery** (5 Minerals + 2 Biomass) - Accelerates unit growth
- **Creep Node** (1 Biomass) - Spreads hive territory

### Resource Management
- **Biomass**: Basic resource for building units
- **Minerals**: Used for structures
- **Genetic Material**: Required for advanced units
- **Secretions**: Generated by living units, used for eggs
- **Eggs**: Can hatch into new units
- **Live Prey**: Collected from defeated enemies

### Game Mechanics
- Worker drones automatically gather resources
- Harvesters hunt enemies and collect genetic material
- Queens lay eggs to expand your population
- Larvae grow into worker drones over time
- Enemies patrol and attack your units
- Resources respawn after depletion

## 🛠️ Current Features

✅ **Complete Resource System**: 6 resource types with storage limits
✅ **Unit AI**: All units have intelligent behavior
✅ **World Building Tools**: Interactive placement system
✅ **Building System**: Cost-based unit and structure creation
✅ **Combat System**: Enemies and harvesters can fight
✅ **Resource Economy**: Resources are collected, stored, and spent
✅ **Game Loop**: Victory/defeat conditions checked
✅ **Pathfinding**: Units navigate around obstacles
✅ **UI System**: Resource display and building menu

## 🎯 Victory Conditions

- **Territory Control**: Cover 75% of the map with creep
- **Population Goal**: Reach 50+ active units
- **Survival**: Survive for 300 seconds (5 minutes)

## 🚨 Defeat Conditions

- **Hive Core Destroyed**: If your main structure is destroyed
- **Population Collapse**: If you have fewer than 3 units
- **Resource Exhaustion**: If all resources are depleted

## 🎨 Graphics

The game currently uses gradient-based graphics for all units and structures:
- **Hive Core**: Purple gradient (32x32)
- **Worker Drone**: Blue gradient (16x16)
- **Harvester**: Orange gradient (20x20)
- **Queen**: Purple gradient (28x28)
- **Larvae**: Yellow gradient (12x12)
- **Enemies**: Orange gradient (24x24)
- **Resources**: Green (biomass) and gray (minerals) gradients

## 🚀 Next Steps for Development

1. **Add Sprites**: Replace gradients with proper artwork
2. **Sound Effects**: Add audio for actions and events
3. **Animations**: Implement unit movement and action animations
4. **More Units**: Add specialized units like healers or scouts
5. **Advanced Structures**: Implement evolution chambers and research
6. **Territory System**: Add creep spreading mechanics
7. **Multiplayer**: Support for cooperative or competitive play

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Units not moving**: Check that NavigationRegion2D is present
- **Resources not spawning**: Verify resource node scripts are attached
- **Game crashes**: Check console for error messages
- **Building not working**: Ensure you have enough resources
- **Performance issues**: Reduce unit count or resource density

## 🎉 Ready to Play!

The game is fully functional with all core mechanics implemented. You can:
- Build units and structures using the world-building tools
- Watch worker drones gather resources automatically
- See the resource economy in action
- Observe enemy movement patterns and combat
